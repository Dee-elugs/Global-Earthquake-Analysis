# 🌍 Global Earthquake Analysis Dashboard

An interactive Tableau dashboard visualizing global earthquake data, focusing on magnitude, distribution, tsunami links, and significance levels.  
This dashboard provides insights into earthquake patterns across the world, helping users understand both geographic and temporal trends.

📊 Built with **Tableau Public**

---

## 🎯 Objective

This project aims to:

- Explore the global distribution of earthquakes.
- Examine trends in earthquake magnitude across specific countries.
- Analyze the relationship between earthquake magnitude and their significance levels.
- Understand the proportion of earthquakes that triggered tsunamis.
- Provide an accessible, visual representation of earthquake activity from historical records.

## 📦 Dashboard Components

The dashboard consists of five key visualizations:

1. **Proportion of Earthquakes That Caused Tsunamis (Pie Chart)**
   - Displays the number and percentage of earthquakes linked to tsunamis.

2. **Earthquake Distribution Worldwide (Map)**
   - Interactive map showing the geographic spread of earthquake occurrences.

3. **Earthquake Magnitude Trends in Peru & Russia (Bar Chart)**
   - Historical trend analysis of earthquake magnitudes for selected countries.

4. **Relationship Between Earthquake Magnitude and Significance Level (Scatter Plot)**
   - Plots the correlation between the earthquake's magnitude and its calculated significance.

5. **Earthquake Magnitude Distribution in 2022 (Single-Year Analysis)**
   - Shows the spread of magnitudes for earthquakes recorded in 2022.

## 💡 Key Insights

- A significant proportion of earthquakes do **not** cause tsunamis.
- Certain regions (e.g., Pacific Ring of Fire) have consistently high earthquake counts.
- Peru and Russia show varying magnitude patterns over the years, with occasional spikes.
- Magnitude and significance level have a strong positive correlation.
- 2022 had a diverse distribution of earthquake magnitudes.

## 🤝 Contributions

Suggestions for improving the dashboard are welcome!  
You can propose:
- Additional filters (e.g., by depth or location type).
- More country-specific trend analyses.
- Adding year-over-year comparison metrics.
